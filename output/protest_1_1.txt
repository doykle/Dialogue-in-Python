A1: So, here's the thing. Today was a very eventful work day.
B1: Wasn't there something more about the today?
A2: Today was the start of the G20 summit.
B2: Right! It happens every year and it is where 20 of the leaders of the world come together to talk about how to run their governments effectively and what not.
A3: The leaders... I'm not remembering the next part, keep going.
B3: Since there are so many leaders coming together there are going to be a lot of people who have different views on how to run the government they follow so they protest.
A4: Right! There was a protest that happened along the street where we work and at first it looked peaceful until a bunch of people started rebelling and creating a riot.
B4: Police cars were burned and things were thrown at cops.
A5: What else was there about the police?
B5: Police were in full riot gear to alleviate the violence.
A6: Right! As things got worse tear gas and bean bag bullets were fired at the rioters while they smash windows of stores.
B6: And this all happened right in front of our store which was kind of scary
A7: But it was kind of interesting since we've never seen a riot before.
